#Assignment 9: Quiz Creator

# The program will ask the user to input questions that the user needs for the quiz.
# Next, the program will ask the user to input the choices (a,b,c,d) that the user wants for the quiz.
# Then, the program will ask the user to input the correct answer for that specific question.
# If the input is valid, then it will break out of the loop.
# Invalid inputs will keep the loop.
# Next, the program will ask the user if he wants to input another question by yes or no.
# The program will exit if the user doesn't want to continue or doesn't need to add any more questions.
